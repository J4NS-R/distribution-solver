# Distributable distribution solver

This program solves a flavour of the Vehicle Routing Problem. Not an elegant solution by any means, but it does support `mpi`, so if you wanna max out 16 computers' CPU's at once trying to solve an arbitrary transportation problem, look no further. 


## Todo's

- Store final result with searchspace, so next run program continues to next space-step
- Set up distribution centre for better managing of distribution kinds.
